/*
 * Object containing the list of all active gondolas
 * However, it seems that a player can have a gondola "unlocked" without it being loaded (and thus part of this map)
 * Therefore, this map should represent the list of all "active" gondolas, that is, that can be used
 * This implies that a player can unlock a gondola that can become inactive in one way or another
 * The main benefit is that it allows to toggle gondolas on and off
 * However this also means that we need to keep track of both the loaded gondolas and all the existing gondolas
 * Therefore, this object contains the list of all **active** gondolas, which is different from the list of all **existing** gondolas
